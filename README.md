# Satellite-Panel-Control
Embedded control code for an Arduino-based satellite demonstrator using servos, a stepper motor, and IR remote inputs.

This repository contains the Arduino code used for a personal satellite demonstrator project.
The code handles IR remote input and coordinates servo, stepper motor, and LED actuation for multiple mechanical functions.
This repository is intended for code reference as part of a project portfolio.
